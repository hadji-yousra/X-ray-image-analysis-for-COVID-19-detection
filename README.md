## Dependencies :
Tensorflow 2.x.x
Opencv-python
pydicom for mask generation

## Pure transfer part :
For this part we have *.py scripts for each architecture (VGG16, CGG19 and Resnet50). The *.py uses the data sets in Data folder to train model. At the end of training, it saves the model and the values of accuracy and loss in a csv file.

The *.ipynb files are used to evaluate models on tests datasets and show results.

You will find the *.py and *.ipynb corresponding to each test.
